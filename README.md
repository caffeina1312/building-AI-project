BUILDING AI COURSE PROJECT

# RECURSIVE MOVEMENT

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
the project foresees the possibility of using an audio/video input hardware, connected to an online database, to analize and predict dangerous situation 
recognizing risky movements or attitudes, such as for isolated elderly people, or during city traffic. but also for entertainment, such as controlling television sets with a simple wave of the hand.
it is possible through a camera system to control recurring movements, recognized by the model as risky, such as the movements of an elderly person living alone, already known to be repetitive in pathological people, and activate a system of notifications and alarms that prevent the behavior dangerous and warn the family.
at the same time, a model could learn the movements of drivers in traffic that lead to accidents or slowdowns and prevent incidents by alerting the relevant authorities, using the cameras already installed by each administration in public streets.
in the end,also a camera installed on a television device can recognize standardized movements known to the user to allow him to control the TV as he would with a smartphone, such as changing channels with the movement with which he would change pages on a tablet.
obviously both the movements of the elderly, of the cars, and of the spectators would have to be learned and shared in an online model



## Background

* this idea would particularly solve the problems of people who have elderly relatives who live alone and often have dangerous repetitive behaviors that cannot be controlled except with 24-hour supervision.

* this idea would also solve many problems of daily traffic, because it would provide help to the authorities but also a deterrent for undisciplined motorists
* this idea can also be commercialized, providing a novelty in TV control that differs from existing voice controls


the first two problems, especially the first, are very frequent, practically daily,an elderly person living alone provides my main motivation, experiencing this situation every day, but this topic is important for anyone, because anyone can have a loved one to check on and anyone would like to drive on a safer road



## How is it used?
the project provides the observation of the cameras already installed by the administrations as a source of training data, concentrating the training on past images that have led to trouble. 
for the entertainment section the data would be easily recovered, being provided a priori to the user who will have to use it.
for the elderly, elderly people who are in nursing homes should be observed and implemented with qualified doctors

I believe a deep learning technique should be used and a classifier that labels repetitive behavior as risky or not
the solution is used in a home context for elderly people and the entertainment sector, while in a city context for the automotive solution
the solution would be used by people who do not have the possibility of checking on a loved one continuously and by city administrators, but also by anyone who owns a television and home connectivity.


## Challenges

the project does not resolve everything that is unpredictable, such as an elderly person's attitude due to a sudden illness or a deliberately caused road accident
the ethical question concerns the elderly person who might feel observed, even if currently many elderly people are already equipped with cameras installed by their children.

## What next?

the project, which is not a project that can be developed DIY, will need funding and the support of sector specialists, such as traffic engineers and doctors specialized in geriatrics
